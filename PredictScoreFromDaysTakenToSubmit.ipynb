    "This project illustrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbor Machine Learning algorithm in its simplest form. It predicts the most likely score based on how long it takes for an assignment to be submitted by a learner. Given this knowledge, Educators and policy makers can influence how, when, and why students should work at a certain pace. Further, given this information, numbers of newly qualified people can be predicted and companies can adjust workforce strategy accordingly."
